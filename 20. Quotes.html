				At the dawn of history India started on her unending quest, and trackless centuries which are filled with her striving and the grandeur of her successes and her failures. 
				Through good and ill fortunes alike, she has never lost sight of that quest or forgotten the ideals which gave her strength. 
				We end today a period of ill fortune and India discovers herself again.
